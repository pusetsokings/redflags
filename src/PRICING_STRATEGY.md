## Messaging & Positioning

### On Free Tier
✅ **Do**: "All core safety features are free forever"
✅ **Do**: "Premium features help support free access for others"

❌ **Don't**: Create artificial urgency or fear-based upsells

### On Premium Tier
✅ **Do**: "Enhanced insights and advanced features"
✅ **Do**: "Support ongoing development and keep core features free"
❌ **Don't**: "Your safety requires premium"
❌ **Don't**: Gate emergency resources or hotlines

### Upgrade Prompts

- **Value-focused**: "See how premium could help with pattern analysis"

## Ethical Guidelines

### Non-Negotiable Principles
1. ✅ **Emergency resources**: Always free, always accessible
2. ✅ **Basic red flags**: Core patterns available to all
3. ✅ **PIN lock**: Basic security never behind paywall
4. ✅ **Export data**: Users own their data, free access
5. ✅ **No artificial limits**: Free tier is genuinely useful
6. ❌ **No dark patterns**: No manipulative upgrade tactics
7. ❌ **No shame**: Never make free users feel "less than"
8. ❌ **No exploitation**: Don't prey on vulnerability

### The "Hospital Test"
> If someone showed up at a hospital emergency room, would we charge them extra for this feature?

If the answer is yes, it's okay to be premium.
If the answer is no, it must be free.
