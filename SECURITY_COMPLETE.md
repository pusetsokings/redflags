# ✅ Security Issue Resolved

## Actions Completed:
✅ **Deleted unauthorized Vercel projects:**
- `redflags-mkgl` - DELETED
- `redflags-kblg` - DELETED
- `redflags` (wheat) - DELETED

✅ **Verified main project:**
- `redflagstracker` → Connected to `pusetsokings/redflags` ✅

## Final Step: Restrict Vercel Integration

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do This Now
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/installations
2. **Click "Configure" on Vercel integration**
3. **Change from "All repositories"**
4. **To "Only select repositories"**
5. **Select ONLY:**
   - ✅ `pusetsokings/redflags`
   - ✅ `pusetsokings/churchhurt` (if you want)
6. **Click "Save"**

**Why:** This prevents future unauthorized access and limits what the integration can do.

---

## Current Security Status:

### ✅ Secured:
- No GitHub collaborators (only you)
- Unauthorized Vercel projects deleted
- Main project verified and connected correctly
- Vercel blocking "witaka" from deploying (security working)

### ⚠️ Pending:
- Restrict Vercel integration to specific repositories (do this now)

---

## What Happened:

1. **"witaka" created unauthorized Vercel projects**
   - They tried to connect to your GitHub repo
   - Vercel blocked them (they're not a team member) ✅
   - But they still created projects

2. **You've now:**
   - Deleted unauthorized projects ✅
   - Verified your main project ✅
   - Need to restrict integration access ⚠️

---

## After Restricting Integration:

1. **"witaka" won't be able to:**
   - Create new Vercel projects connected to your repos
   - Access your repositories through the integration
   - Deploy to your projects

2. **Vercel will continue:**
   - Blocking their deployment attempts
   - Sending you emails if they try again
   - Protecting your projects

---

## Monitoring:

### Watch for 24-48 hours:
- ✅ New unauthorized Vercel projects
- ✅ Vercel emails about "witaka"
- ✅ GitHub activity log for suspicious activity

### If "witaka" tries again:
- Vercel will block them (already working)
- You'll get an email notification
- No action needed (Vercel security is working)

---

## Security Best Practices:

1. ✅ **Always use "Only select repositories"** for integrations
2. ✅ **Review integrations monthly**
3. ✅ **Delete unused projects**
4. ✅ **Monitor deployment emails**
5. ✅ **Keep repositories private**
6. ✅ **Don't add unknown collaborators**

---

## You're Almost Done!

Just one more step:
**Restrict the Vercel integration to "Only select repositories"**

Then you're fully secured! 🎉
