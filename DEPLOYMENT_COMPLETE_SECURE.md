## 🔒 CRITICAL: Verify Security Settings NOW

### Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard (2 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/pkwelagobe-gmailcoms-projects/flagsense
2. **Click**: "Settings" (top menu)
3. **Check these sections**:

#### A. General → Team
- ✅ Should show ONLY your account
- ❌ If you see "Witaka" or anyone else → **REMOVE THEM IMMEDIATELY**
- Click "..." → "Remove from Team"

#### B. Git → Repository
- Currently: Not connected (manual deployments)
- **Optional**: Connect GitHub for auto-deploy (see Step 2 below)

#### C. Environment Variables
- Should be empty (unless you add API keys later)
- These are secure and private

#### D. Deployments
- Check recent deployments
- ✅ Should all show YOUR account as creator
- ❌ If any show "Witaka" → That's from old project (ignore, it's deleted)

---

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect GitHub for Auto-Deploy (Optional but Recommended)

### Why Connect Git?
- Automatic deployments when you push to GitHub
- Better security (Vercel only deploys from YOUR repo)
- Deployment history tied to commits

### How to Connect:

1. **Go to**: Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
2. **Click**: "Connect Git Repository"
3. **Select**: GitHub
4. **Authorize**: Make sure you're authorizing with YOUR GitHub account
5. **Select Repository**: `pusetsokings/redflags`
6. **Select Branch**: `main`
7. **Settings** (auto-detected):
   - Framework: Vite
   - Root Directory: `./`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
8. **Click**: "Deploy"

### Verify After Connecting:
- Go to Settings → Git
- Should show: `pusetsokings/redflags`
- Should show: "Connected by: [YOUR ACCOUNT]"
- Should NOT show: "Connected by: Witaka"

## 🚫 Step 3: Remove Any Unauthorized Access

### If You See "Witaka" or Unauthorized Users:

#### In Vercel:
1. Settings → General → Team
2. Find unauthorized user
3. Click "..." → "Remove from Team"

#### In GitHub:
1. Go to: https://github.com/pusetsokings/redflags/settings/access
2. Check "Collaborators"
3. Remove any unauthorized users

#### Revoke Vercel Access (if needed):
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/applications
2. Find "Vercel" in authorized apps
3. If authorized by someone else → "Revoke"
4. Re-authorize in Vercel Dashboard with YOUR account
