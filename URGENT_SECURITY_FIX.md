# 🚨 URGENT: Security Breach - Unauthorized Access

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED

You have **multiple Vercel projects you didn't create**, all connected to your GitHub repository. This means **someone has unauthorized access** to your GitHub account or repository.

## Unauthorized Projects Found:
1. ❌ `redflags-mkgl` - NOT YOURS
2. ❌ `redflags-kblg` - NOT YOURS  
3. ❌ `redflags` (redflags-wheat.vercel.app) - NOT YOURS
4. ✅ `redflagstracker` - YOURS (keep this)
5. ✅ `churchhurt` - YOURS (if you created it)
6. ✅ `silence-breaker-app` - YOURS (if you created it)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These NOW)

### Step 1: Secure Your GitHub Account (URGENT)
1. **Change GitHub Password:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/security
   - Change password immediately
   - Use a strong, unique password

2. **Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/security
   - Enable 2FA with an authenticator app
   - Save recovery codes securely

3. **Check Active Sessions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/security
   - Review "Active sessions"
   - Sign out all unknown devices

4. **Check Authorized Applications:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/applications
   - Revoke access to any unknown apps
   - Especially check OAuth apps

### Step 2: Remove GitHub Collaborators
1. Go to: https://github.com/pusetsokings/redflags/settings/access
2. **Check Collaborators:**
   - Look for "witaka" or any unknown users
   - Remove them immediately
3. **Check Teams:**
   - Remove any teams you didn't create
4. **Check Deploy Keys:**
   - Remove any unknown deploy keys

### Step 3: Check GitHub Webhooks
1. Go to: https://github.com/pusetsokings/redflags/settings/hooks
2. **Review All Webhooks:**
   - Check who created them
   - Delete any created by "witaka" or unknown users
   - Keep only the one for YOUR Vercel project

### Step 4: Delete Unauthorized Vercel Projects
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **For each unauthorized project:**
   - `redflags-mkgl` → Settings → Delete Project
   - `redflags-kblg` → Settings → Delete Project
   - `redflags` (wheat) → Settings → Delete Project
3. **Keep only:**
   - `redflagstracker` (your main project)
   - `churchhurt` (if yours)
   - `silence-breaker-app` (if yours)

### Step 5: Reconnect Vercel Securely
1. **Disconnect and Reconnect:**
   - Go to your `redflagstracker` project
   - Settings → Git
   - Disconnect repository
   - Reconnect with YOUR GitHub account
   - Verify it's connected correctly

### Step 6: Check All Your Repositories
1. Go to: https://github.com/pusetsokings?tab=repositories
2. **Review each repository:**
   - Check collaborators
   - Check webhooks
   - Check for unauthorized access

## How This Likely Happened

1. **GitHub Account Compromised:**
   - Weak password
   - No 2FA enabled
   - Phishing attack
   - Shared credentials

2. **Repository Access:**
   - Collaborator added without your knowledge
   - OAuth app granted access
   - Deploy key added

3. **Vercel Integration:**
   - Attacker connected your repo to their Vercel account
   - Created multiple projects to test/deploy

---

## Prevention Going Forward

1. **Always use 2FA** on GitHub
2. **Never share credentials**
3. **Review collaborators regularly**
4. **Monitor repository activity**
5. **Use strong, unique passwords**
6. **Review OAuth app access**
7. **Check Vercel projects regularly**

---

## After Securing

1. **Monitor for 24-48 hours:**
   - Check GitHub activity log
   - Check Vercel deployments
   - Watch for new unauthorized projects

2. **If issues continue:**
   - Contact GitHub support
   - Contact Vercel support
   - Consider creating a new GitHub account

## DO THIS NOW (Priority Order)

1. ⚠️ **Change GitHub password** (5 minutes)
2. ⚠️ **Enable 2FA on GitHub** (5 minutes)
3. ⚠️ **Remove unauthorized collaborators** (2 minutes)
4. ⚠️ **Delete unauthorized Vercel projects** (5 minutes)
5. ⚠️ **Reconnect Vercel securely** (2 minutes)
6. ⚠️ **Review all repositories** (10 minutes)

**Total time: ~30 minutes to secure everything**
